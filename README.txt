    - To make money off stocks that are long term doing well and starting to fall short due to momentum throughout the day 
        - >A larger tick size will allow for profit taking via selling covered calls when they lose momentum
            - >>Use analysis throughout the day to track momentum, try to stay as in stocks as possible, we do believe the stock will do well after all
                - >>>We can make money off stocks that are long term doing well

And we have the inverse. 

    - To make money off stocks that are long term doing poorly and starting to rise due to momentum throughout the day
        - >A larger tick size will allow for profit taking via selling cash-secured puts when they lose momentum
            - >>Use analysis throughout the day to track momentum, try to stay as in cash as possible, since we believe the stocks are going to do poorly
                - >>>We can make money off stocks that are long term doing poorly

Usage:
python short.py {TICKER} {SELL_COUNT} - use this on stocks you think are doing poorly in the long term
